# whose-turn-is-it-anyways
Program I made for my children to make a decision when they disagree.
This program uses a random number generator to pick a child, then the child picks the game of chance they wish to play.
Games include "Flip the Coin", "Rock, Paper, Scissors", and "Closest to the Number".
